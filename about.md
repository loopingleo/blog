title: About Me
---

I'm a data scientist at Daimler/Mercedes-Benz, working on risk models for financial and mobility services.

I'm interested in all aspects of data science and advanced analytics, with my primary interests laying in developing analytics and machine learning scripts for fraud detection. I mostly program in R and Python nowadays, but I have experience with Java, Visual Basic, and SQL programming. I would like to consider myself a data lover, I enjoy delving deep into datasets to find hidden patterns and improve status quo.
